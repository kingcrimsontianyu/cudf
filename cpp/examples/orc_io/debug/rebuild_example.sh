# Rebuild libcudf
# In nvcc, compiler options -E and -MD cannot be used together. However:
# - Adding the device debug symbol (-G) for a selected set of .cu files
#   appears to cause -MD to be added as a compiler option. Meanwhile,
# - sccache always forces -E to be appended even when export CCACHE_DISABLE=1
#   is used.
# Given this conundrum, the hacky solution is to manually remove the use of
# sccache from the build.ninja file, before building libcudf with the device
# debug symbol added.
